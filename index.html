            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As a third-year student majoring in Computer Engineering, my 
                journey is fueled by a profound passion for both backend and
                frontend development. Each line of code I write is a 
                testament to my dedication to mastering the intricacies 
                of Embedded Systems, IoT Engineering, and Cloud Computing 
                on Google Cloud. But it's not just about technical prowessâ€”it's
                about understanding how these technologies intersect with human
                needs and societal challenges. With every project, I aim to 
                bridge the gap between innovation and real-world impact, striving 
                to create user-centric solutions that resonate with people's 
                lives. My commitment to continuous learning and skill refinement 
                underscores my unwavering determination to push the boundaries
                of what's possible in the digital realm.</p>
